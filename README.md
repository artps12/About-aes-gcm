# About-aes-gcm
Hi Amit Kulkarni,

I have a question regarding developing an aes-gcm from your aes cbc code uploaded in the openssl-evp-demo.
Since three days ago, I have been searching for your email address, but it is difficult to find.

May I know your private email address, please? I want to ask about your code developed with OpenSSL development library.
I tried to revise it, but I can have the same decrypted data, but I have got notification of wrong authentication.

Hopefully, you are willing to help me. My email address is: dmoby7004@gmail.com
Please drop me an email, so I may ask the question to you letter. I am not a machine, or program, I am definitely a human.

Best,
Moby
